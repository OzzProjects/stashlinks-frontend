# StashLinks

Stash Links is chrome extension for users to save their visited sites and visit them once again. At times, when browsing online you may encounter a site that contains useful information but as a user you might not have the time to read through it all. Instead of, bookmarking the site on your browser, save the site with Stash Links in one place.

Stash Links currently takes urls with the Chrome Api to the local server. A public version is to be developed.
